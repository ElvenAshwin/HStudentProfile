# HStudentProfile
A StudentProfiler for the NUS High School curriculum written in Haskell - with 
a philosophy focused on removing partial functions in order to ensure
correctness. The profiler should be able to, once fed all the modules taken
by a student, calculate their CAP for various contexts: biennial CAP,
grad CAP, subject CAP, semestral GPA so on and so forth. Whilst the core
goal of the project is a core library for manipulation of NUSH academic
objects through a command line interface, further extensions involving a GUI
and the ability to manipulate other, non-academic records dealing with student
profiles.

The project is aimed to be completed in Pure Haskell, with no need for language
extensions.
